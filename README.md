# US-Arrests
## Business Understanding
Violent crime in the United States refers to murder, rape and sexual assault, robbery, and assault. It is important to note that violent crime rates may not always be precise as crimes that remain unreported can often skew rates meaning it can generally be assumed that instances of crime are more prevalent than reported crime statistics suggest.

## Business Objective
USArrests data is the arrest data from 1973. This is a public dataset available in R. For more details on the dataset see https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/USArrests.html. This data set contains statistics, in arrests per 100,000 residents for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states in 1973. It also contains the percentage of people in the state who live in an urban area. The aim is to see if there is any dependency between the state and the arrest history. Clustering allows us to identify which observations are alike, and potentially categorize them therein.

## Goals of Data Analysis
In this project, we will analyse arrest data using unsupervised learning. Unsupervised learning is a statistical technique for exploring and discovering knowledge, from a multivariate data, without building a predictive models. It helps to visualize the relationship between variables, as well as, to identify groups of similar observations.
