# US-Arrests
In this project, we will analyse arrest data using unsupervised learning. Unsupervised learning is a statistical technique for exploring and discovering knowledge, from a multivariate data, without building a predictive models. It helps to visualize the relationship between variables, as well as, to identify groups of similar observations.
